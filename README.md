# Smart-Hack-
The situation of public healthcare system of India is egregious, following are some major problems we witnessed/heard in our visit to Safdarjung and AIIMS hospital(two of the biggest hospitals in India). These problems are they key reasons which makes India to succumb in International Rankings despite the presence of universal healthcare. 1. Long waiting time in OPD lines(It leads to both financial and mortal consequences most people tend to avoid visiting doctors till the situation is unbearable). 2. Malpractices in Healthcare Industry. 3. Delays in specialised care(Most government hospitals sends all patients to a general physician first and only then they are further forwarded to specialised care). 4.  Lack of proper medical records(These are extremely helpful in the cases of emergencies). Our Solution : We bring out one single solution called Shack, we believe that shack will not just only solve the above mentioned problems but also help us achieve  maximum out of our current Healthcare Infrastructure. Shack is a technology which can be used to book speciality specific appointments after accounting for the symptoms(patients only need to report their symptoms   and shack will do the rest), hence solving our problem statement 3. SHack will maintain an e-record for all the symptoms presented and hence solving the problem no. 2 and 4. This online portal will make it possible to book appointments on a particular date and time(for specialised care, similar to nordic nations) hence aiding in crowd control in OPDs(hence solving the statement no 1 ) . Key Features of our Solution: 1. Easy to use even for the unprivileged members of the society, the login process will be simple and all details will fetched just through 1 touch.(We are using an rfId card to demonstrate this but in real life implementation we will switch to fingerprints(Aadhar), we are using rfid since we couldn't get access to aadhar api). 2. Most of the times general populations isn't too aware of the medical procedures done then and hence are not able to ask suitable questions or consider alternatives. SHack will have a feature which patients can use to get insight about any medical procedure. It also will have videos demonstrating various post-operative care and hence reducing complications.
